# Zoo-Seewiesen-Exercise
A website created as part of my Web Dev class at Coders.bay - its written in HTML  &amp; CSS

Project name: Zoo Seewiesen

Description:
This was a project I had to build during my Web Development Classes at Codersbay. 
The task was creating a Zoo Website with 3 pages:

- A Welcome page with a definition List, an embedded youtube video, as well as some Images.
- An Information Page with a Table for details regarding some of our animals
- A Contact me Page with a Form which includes everything I used.

I used only HTML & CSS since at this point we did not yet cover JS.
I also used Flexbox which i added voluntarily since this too was not yet part of the task.

The style sheet is a bit all over the place, since during my time of working on this website I learned many new things & started grasping others.
Thus, I added and added, whereas other things were thrown out.
This website has been a very nice playground and I would love to refine it further, however, the next assignment is already waiting.


I built the website all by myself, within the span of ~10 hours.
